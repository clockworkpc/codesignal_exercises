This is a demonstration of my approach to solving basic coding problems in Python.
It contains tests and solutions under the following headings:

1. Basic Coding
2. Data Manipulation
3. Implementation Efficiency
4. Problem Solving


## Module 1: Basic Coding

- Basic operations with numbers 
- Basic string manipulation, such as splitting a string into substrings or modifying the elements of a string
- Basic array manipulation, such as iterating over an array

## Module 2: Data Manipulation

- Working with numbers, including
    * Basic operations with numbers 
    * Splitting numbers into digits
- Basic string manipulation
    * Splitting a string into substrings
    * Comparing strings
- Modifying elements of a string
    * Concatenating strings
    * Reversing strings
- Basic array manipulation 
    * Iterating over an array
    * Modifying the elements of an array 
    * Reversing an array
    * Concatenating two arrays 

## Module 3: Implementation Efficiency

- Includes everything from module 1 and module 2
- Splitting overall requirements into subtasks or functions
- Manipulating multidimensional arrays, for example:
    * Iterating over elements within nested arrays in a given order
    * Transposing or pivoting the rows and columns values in a 2D array
- Using built in hashmaps to store 
strings or integers as keys

## Module 4: Problem Solving

- Includes everything from module 1, module 2, and module 3
- Implementing common algorithms to optimize solutions, such as greedy, divide and conquer, and two pointers
- Implementing abstract data types such as hashmaps within solutions
- Discrete mathematics fundamentals
